      "Rupe and Hina were brother and sister, but they loved each other with a love greater than that of most brothers and sisters. So close was the bond between them that they were scarcely happy except when together.",
      "One day Hina fell into the sea and was carried out by the tide. Fortunately she wore a magic girdle. This protected her from death, but she went floating out over the horizon, miles away from her home and parents and beloved brother. Nobody had seen her fall. When she was missed there was a grief-stricken search. No trace of her could be found.",
      "“She must be dead,” her friends whispered. Rupe overheard them. “She is not dead,” he cried. “Something in my heart tells me she is not dead. I go to find her.”",
      "He set off, travelling from one end of the land to the other, seeking her. For months, for over a year, he sought her fruitlessly. In the meantime she was floating, drifting through the sea, upborne by the waves, saved by the magic girdle from every death that threatened her. In her slow progress little seaweed tendrils clasped themselves about her, pink-tipped bar­nacles attached themselves to her.",
      "For many months she floated on, till at last she was thrown up by the surf on the sandy beach of a little island. There she lay, helpless and unconscious from her long voyage in the water. The people of the island found her, took her in, gently scraped off the sea-things that still clung to her, and showed her every kindness. After a while the king heard of her, and was so charmed with her sweetness and beauty that he took her to live in his royal home. So a year passed by.",
      "Just at this time Rupe gave up seeking for her on the land. “I will go to Rehua,” he said. Repeating a powerful spell, he changed himself into a pigeon. He had a long, weary flight before him to the highest Sky-land, for this was where Rehua lived. Rehua was the greatest of all Sky-fairies. He knew everything; he would surely know where Rina was.",
      "Soaring bravely, Rupe mounted higher and higher, his love for his sister upholding his tiring wings. Up he went, through the great sun-filled spaces, till he reached the first Sky-land. From that to the second, the third, the fourth, on to the tenth. At last he stood before Rehua!",
      "“Murmurs concerning you have risen to me from a little island in the sea,” was Rehua’s answer to the question Rupe put to him. He pointed out the island in the world that lay so far below. Back to the earth, straight as a stone in his course for the little island, Rupe took his down­ward flight. Alighting at Hina’s dwelling-place, he flew to her window-sill. There he waited to be seen by her.",
      "Some of the king’s servants saw him. “See! A pigeon on the sill,” they said. One brought a spear and tried to spear him, but Rupe turned the spear aside with his bill, so that it broke on the wood of the window-sill. Another brought a noose and tried to snare him, but each time he turned his head aside and the noose fell away. ” Magic!” cried the servants. “A magic bird! We cannot harm him.”",
      "They told Hina of the magic visitor. “Leave the bird alone while I look at it,” she said. Long and earnestly she looked. “It is my brother! ” she cried at last. “It is Rupe.”",
      "Taking again his natural shape, Rupe embraced his long-lost sister, telling her the story of his weary search for her. In return, she told him of her strange voyage and her life on this far island, where king and people were all kindness to her.",
      "“Come with me to the tenth Sky-land, where Rehua lives,” said Rupe. “There is brightness such as never glows on this low earth. There is beauty, there is joy. There we may live together all our lives.”",
      "“I will come,” said Rina. By spells Rupe changed their shapes to those of pigeons. To­gether they flew through the upper sunlit spaces till they reached the tenth Sky-land. There, with Rehua, they spent together their  happy days."

    "title": "How the Moon Was Made",

    "content": [
      "Long, long ago, before there was a moon in the sky, there lived two beautiful maidens who loved each other dearly. One was called by a name that meant Shining-Eyes, and the other by a name that meant Rippling-Hair.",
      "Shining-Eyes had heard a great deal about the Fire-that-never-goes-out. She often talked to Rippling-Hair about it. “It is kept in one of the underworlds,” she said. “Fierce spirits guard it day and night. If we could bring it away we should obtain the Life-that-never-dies. Think of it. Unending Life! What a gift that would be to the world!”",
      "One day she said, “Will you come with me to look for it?”",
      "“The journey is too dangerous,” cried Rippling- Hair. “Besides, there are those terrible spirits! We should never return alive.”",
      "“Wait! I have a plan,” said Shining-Eyes. We might take a basket of kumaras to the spirits. While they eat the sweet earth-fruits we can snatch away a fire-stick and run off with it.”",
      "“But they would catch us.”",
      "“I think not. We are both swift runners, and we should have a good start.”",
      "“Our fathers may not let us go.”",
      "“We need not say where we are going, nor mention the dangers of the journey. It will be enough to say that we wish to take a little trip together.”",
      "Rippling-Hair still looked doubtful, but Shining- Eyes took her hands and looked into her eyes. ” I am going, dear friend,” she said. “I have thought of it night and day until I must go. I cannot give it up. But you—do not come if your heart fails you. I do not wish to lead you into danger.”",
      "“Where you go I shall go—you know that!” cried Rippling-Hair.",
      "“Then come with me to find the Fire-that-never-goes-out,” laughed Shining-Eyes, “for that is where I am going.”",
      "“I will come,” said Rippling-Hair, though she trembled at the thought. Afterwards, when the real dangers came, she forgot her fears and went through everything as bravely as Shining- Eyes herself.",
      "They obtained the consent of their parents to leave home, made all their arrangements as if for a short visit to a neighbouring village, and started off, taking with them food for themselves on the way and a basket of kumaras for the spirits. At first the track was pleasant enough. It led over a sunny plain and past a gently-flowing river. But when they came to the dark bush- lands their troubles began. Every tree and bramble, every bird and insect in the bush, knew why Shining-Eyes and Rippling-Hair were travelling north, and they all tried to turn them back from the death they risked.",
      "The tall trees interlocked their boughs to shut out the sun and make the pathway dark. “You will lose your way. Turn back before it is too late,” they sighed. And many times the two girls lost their way.",
      "“Turn back before it is too late,” said the brambles, the thorny wait-a-bits. They caught the friends, holding them with their curved claws, and tearing their hands and faces till they bled.",
      "“Turn back before it is too late,” piped the birds and insects. They stole what food they could when the maidens were not watching, so that hunger should drive them back to safety.",
      "But Shining-Eyes and Rippling-Hair would not be turned back. Although after many days their sufferings had weakened them so sorely that they fell at the foot of a great tree-fern and could not rise, they did not lose heart. All their food was gone except the basket of kumaras for the spirits, they were footsore, and numb with weariness, but they said: “We shall sleep and wake up strengthened. We must not, will not give in.”",
      "From among the fronds of the tree-fern peeped the kindly faces of watching forest fairies. They heard the brave words, and saw the worn-out girls drop off to sleep. “Let us help them,” said one. “The bush has done its best to stop them, but they will not be stopped. Perhaps their courage will carry them safely to their journey’s end.”",
      "They trooped down from the tree-fern, carried the sleepers to the fairy palace, and laid them on beds of softest down to dream the night away. In the morning they brought magic foods and drinks that took away all pain and weariness.",
      "The two girls, strong and well once more, went on their way with grateful, happy hearts. Leaving the bush behind, they came into the mountain-land. The mountains put forth all their terrors to turn them back from death. Little hills raised themselves into mountains to tire their feet, mountains stretched themselves almost to the sky. The girls went on as if nothing had happened ; the hills and mountains, seeing this, fell back again to their old size, and the girls climbed over them with ease. Sometimes great rocks sprang suddenly into their path; deep clefts opened before their feet; mountain storms roared about their heads ; once a mountain giant chased them.",
      "But they neither faltered nor turned back, and at last the mountains said, “Leave them alone. Their courage will carry them safely through to their purpose.”",
      "They came at last to the end of the land. Below them lay the sea, above them towered a beautiful tree with crimson flowers. They stood on the edge of the cliff and looked at the twisted roots that led from the tree down the face of the rock to the beach below.",
      "“The tree is called Spray-Sprinkled,” said Shining-Eyes. ” Between its lowest roots lies the opening to the underworld. To that higher point above us come each night the souls of those who have died during the day. There they pause once to sigh, then fling themselves below to enter that dark underworld. If we can save our friends from death and this sad end, our sufferings on the way have been worth while.”",
      "Through the night they rested. When the morning broke they descended by the roots and found the opening to the underworld. A narrow passage, dark as night, led into the earth. Trembling, they entered in, groping their slow way with beating hearts. After a long time a gleam of light shone out in front. They walked faster. Coming to the end of the passage, they peeped out. Before them lay a wide open plain, lit by a fire made of three sticks crossed. In front of the fire sat three fierce old spirits. “The Fire-that-never-goes-out! ” whispered Shining-Eyes. “Give me the kumaras.”",
      "Silently as they could the girls approached the fire. But the spirits heard their steps. “Mortals!” they shrieked, starting up in anger.",
      "Shining-Eyes held out the basket of kumaras. “See,” she said, ” we have brought you these earth-fruits. You have none so sweet down here.”",
      "Astonished at her boldness, the spirits took the kumaras and crowded round to taste them. Stooping, Shining-Eyes snatched a fire-stick from the ground and flew with Rippling-Hair towards the entrance to the passage. They had almost reached the entrance when screams of rage behind them told them that their trick was discovered. “Quick, oh, quick!” breathed Shining-Eyes.",
      "Up the long passage, now lit by the flaming stick, they fled with desperate swiftness. Behind them came the spirits, gaining on them with every step. “If only we can keep the lead till we reach the opening,” panted Rippling-Hair in front. “Ah, here it is. We are saved.”",
      "She sprang through the opening, turned, and grasped her friend’s hand to pull her through. But at that moment one of the spirits reached Shining-Eyes and seized her heel. “I am held,” gasped Shining-Eyes.",
      "She struggled wildly, while Rippling-Hair pulled with all her strength. They could not free her heel. “Drop the fire-stick and give me both hands/” Rippling-Hair whispered. ” Drop it, or you will be pulled back, and that means death.” “I will not lose it. It is unending life! cried Shining-Eyes. With one tremendous effort she hurled it far into the sky.",
      "Seizing the freed hand, Rippling-Hair jerked her friend out of the spirit’s grasp on to the sandy beach above the opening. The spirits dared not come above the ground. They fled back through the passage, screaming with rage at the loss of their cherished stick.",
      "The girls lay panting on the beach, their eyes directed to the flaming stick. From where Shining-Eyes had flung it, it whirled higher and yet higher, faster and faster, until it whirled itself into a ball. Rangi looked down and saw it coming. He put out his hand and caught it, and fitted it into a niche in the sky. Calling the North Wind, he gave him a message for the girls.",
      "“Tell them,” he said, “that unending life is not for the people of the earth. But tell them also that their brave deed is not lost, for the Fire- that-never-goes-out shall stay in the sky to give light when the sun is away. Through it I can look down upon the Earth-mother at night; by its light men shall see to walk when otherwise it would be dark. Let the maidens return to their homes, knowing that for ever men will bless them for the good deed they have done.”",
      "The girls listened to the message and were comforted for the loss of the stick. They retraced their steps, arriving home in safety to relate their doings to their friends. astonished, but they saw the new great light in the sky, so they believed the girls and loved them for their noble courage. And the great light still shines on in the sky. Men call it the Moon."

      "How when Maui was cast away by his mother, the winds and the waves took care of him.",
      "On a dark summer night, many hundreds of years ago, a woman was standing on the shore of the South Pacific Ocean. She was not a white woman, for that was long before any white people had found their way to New Zealand or even knew that there was such a country. She was a Maori woman with a brown skin, soft dark eyes and long black hair, thick and wavy. No one has ever been able to find out where the Maoris really came from; but they have a great many strange and beautiful stories which have been handed down from father to son for hun-\ndreds of years, and this story of Maui and his wonderful exploits is one of them.",
      "The Maori woman had a tiny brown baby in her arms, and was wrapping it round and round with great locks of her hair which she had been cutting off with her knife. Then she lifted up the poor crying baby high in her arms, and threw it out to sea as far as she could ; and then went back to her home under the tall tree ferns — for in New Zealand the ferns grow as tall as trees. She had four boys already in the family and did not want this new baby.",
      "But if his mother was not, the Waves of the Sea were sorry for the poor baby, and they rocked him to sleep in a cradle that they made for him out of the thick seaweeds, and the Breezes sang soft lullabies to him.",
      "When the mighty Hurricanes and Wind Squalls looked down from the mountain tops, and saw what the Ocean had done, they pitied the poor baby, all alone on the great dark waters, and blew gently on the waves that were taking him to shore, to help them along more quickly.",
      "The waves laid the baby, whose name was Maui, gently on a bed of soft jelly fish, where swarms of bright winged flies came and buzzed around him to keep away the other insects that might other- wise have stung him.",
      "But some fierce Birds of Prey saw the baby lying there in the morning, and would have torn him to pieces if Rangi — the great god of the Heavens, as the Maoris called him — had not seen them, and called to the gods of the Mountain-tops to bring the baby up to him. So that was the way that Maui, the little brown earthborn baby, was saved by the gods, and brought up in the Skies, where they taught him many things unknown to the people who lived upon the Earth.",
      "Maui grew up very clever, but he did not grow up beautiful, for one of his eyes was bright brown and the other bright green, like the green stone of which the Maoris have always made their ornaments, and his body was tattooed all over with wonderful figures and designs.",
      "He began to be dull as he grew older and soon complained because there were no other children\nto play with. He knew he was not a child of the gods, or he would have been a god, too, so he asked the gods to tell him about his father and mother. Then they told him how his mother, Taranga, had thrown him into the Sea, and that he had four brothers and a sister on Earth.",
      "“I want to go down to them, and see what the World is like where men live,” he said.",
      "So the gods told him he might go, and that he was to teach men what he had learned in the Heavens; and Maui went down to Earth on the wings of the Wind, and found his four brown brothers playing on the sand.",
      "At first they would not believe he was their brother, and called their mother to drive him away; and his mother would not have anything to do with him, either, until he said : “I am your youngest child, mother, and when I was a little baby you threw me into the Sea.”",
      "Then Maui told his mother how he had been saved by his Ancestors, the gods, and brought up by them in the Heavens; and then his mother knew that he was indeed her boy, and she was very glad, for she had often felt sorry that she had thrown her baby into the Sea.",
      "Then she called him to her, and they rubbed noses for a long time, which is the way Maoris always kiss, and that night Maui slept beside her on a mat, for Maoris do not sleep upon a bed, but on a mat made of feathers or the fibre of the flax plant.",
      "All this made Maui’s brothers very angry and jealous. “Our mother never wants us to sleep with her on her mat, or to rub noses a long time. Why should she wish to do so with this little brat?” they said.",
      "But it was not long before they found out that Maui could teach them many things which they did not know before, and so they began to like him. He taught them to make better pots for catching eels; how to make barbed spears and fish-hooks; how to make yams grow, and many other things that Maori boys know now, but did not know then.",
      "All the other boys of his tribe were afraid of Maui, who was so strong and so clever. But they did not yet know that he could do things which no men could do, only the gods in the Heavens.",
      "Now Maui’s mother went away every morning at dawn, and often did not come back until evening, and he wondered where she went. He had asked her, but she would not tell him ; and when he asked his brothers, they said:",
      "“We do not know, and we do not care. Whether she goes north or south, it is all the same to us.”",
      "They were not good boys, or kind to their mother; but Maui said, “I care, for I love my mother, and I do not like to have her go away alone, and be gone all day.",
      "“Perhaps she goes to the place where they know how to make fire. She goes to some place where there is fire, for the food which she sometimes brings back is cooked.",
      "“I should like to know how to make fire, too. But you are older than I, and you ought to follow our mother.”",
      "But his brothers said again that they did not care where their mother went, and they could not understand why Maui should care.",
      "So Maui saw he would have to follow his mother alone ; and one night, when she was asleep, he took away her girdle and the mat she wore by day. In those days Maori women wore for clothes long shawls called mats, that they draped around them. They often wear them in these days, but though they are called mats, they are really not like a mat at all, but more like the long garments the ancient Romans wore many hundreds of years ago.",
      "So Maui took the girdle and mat and hid them, knowing that his mother would not go away without them, and that only he knew where they could be found. Of course, Taranga looked for her mat when she awoke, but she could not find it, so she picked up an old one and went away. Maui waked up just in time to follow her. Away she went down a fern gully, till she stopped before two large black rocks, and Maui hid in the tall ferns to watch her.",
      "Then Taranga sang a magic song, and suddenly the rocks divided, and she passed through them out of sight. Then they closed up again. But Maui had listened to her song and remembered it, and he went back and repeated it to his brothers, and told them how he had seen his mother disappear between the two great black rocks.",
      "“But why did you not go after her?” they asked.",
      "“You are so clever, and the gods love you.”",
      "“I am going after her,” Maui repHed. “I will turn myself into a pigeon, so that, if she sees me she will think how pretty I am, and not be angry with me.”",
      "Once before he had pleased his mother by turning himself into a wild pigeon, like those that fly\nabout in the bush, and she had told him how beautiful he looked.",
      "The next day, as soon as it was light, Maui went to the two rocks, and repeated the magic song he had heard his mother sing. Then the two rocks flew apart, and he saw between them what seemed to be a dark, bottomless pit.",
      "On either side was a fierce spirit. They had hideous faces and tongues of flame; and they gnashed their teeth, raised their huge claw-like hands in the air, and hissed with rage when they saw an unknown mortal.",
      "But when they rushed at him, Maui turned himself into a pigeon, and flew down the dark passage between the rocks. One of the spirits caught at his tail, but only pulled out a few feathers and Maui flew on to the World Below.",
      "Now the World Below was the place where men and women were then supposed to go when they had finished their lives on Earth. It was very much like the World Above, only it was always in twilight, for the Sun could not shine in there very well.",
      "Maui looked about for his mother, and soon saw her sitting beside a man who he supposed must be his father, but she did not see him. Then Maui took a hard berry in his beak and dropped it on his father’s head ; but his father took no notice of it, thinking it was only a ripe berry falling from the trees.",
      "Then Maui let another berry fall, and this time his mother looked up, and saw that it was a pigeon. Now Taranga knew that there were no pigeons in the World Below, and when some people began to throw stones at the bird, but could not hit it, she said:",
      "“Perhaps it is that wonderful boy, Maui. I left him on Earth, but he must have followed me here.”",
      "Maui heard what she said, and cooed softly in reply, and his mother knew his voice and called him to come down to her.",
      "Then Maui came down and turned into his own form again, and stood beside his mother. And his mother told him that his father should sprinkle him with soft magic water that belonged to Tane, the god of Light, so that when he grew up to be a man, he might be able to do great and wonderful things.",
      "Then she told him that he must go where Hine, the goddess of Death, lived. “You must destroy her, and free all mankind from her power,” she said.",
      "So Maui was sprinkled with the magic water; and his father repeated over him a great many magic verses; but unhappily he forgot one, and when he remembered it was too late.",
      "Then he was very sad, for he knew if Maui ever went to the land of Hine, he would not conquer her, but she would conquer him, and he would never come back. Still, it was many years before Maui went to the land of Hine, and before that time he did many wonderful things.",
      "How Maui went to his Grandmother in the World Below, and took away the Magic Jawbone which enabled her to do won- derful things — not without difficulty, however, for his grandmother was a very unpleasant old woman.",
      "While Maui was down in the World Below he learned that his grandmother, Muri, lived there. She was a very unpleasant old woman, but she had a magic jawbone, which made her able to do wonderful things, and Maui thought he would like to get it.",
      "Muri was really a terrible old woman. She would eat up any mortal whom she could catch, and nobody seemed to love her. She lived all alone, though someone had to take food to her every day.",
      "“I mean to get that jawbone,” said Maui to himself. *’I will take her some food.” So day after day he took food and put it near her dwelling, but he never saw her. At last he thought that if he left food at some distance from the place, she would\nhave to come out to look for it. So he did this, and then hid himself and waited. After a while, his grandmother came out, grinding her jaws and puffing out her cheeks. She seemed to think there must be some mortal about, for she sniffed loudly.",
      "First she sniffed to the west, but she could find no one there; then she sniffed to the north, but could find no one there ; then she sniffed to the east, but could find no one there ; and at last she sniffed to the south, and smelt a man.",
      "Then she made herself bigger and bigger, thinking what a feast she would have. “Who are you?” she cried in a dreadful voice. ”The south wind touches my skin. Did it bring you?”",
      "“Yes, it brought me,” said Maui.",
      "The old woman was greatly disappointed when she recognized Maui*s voice, for she could not eat her own grandson, so she shrank back to her usual size.",
      "“Why do you come here to play tricks on me, Maui?” she asked.",
      "“I came for your jawbone, grandmother; the one with which you do such wonderful things,” Maui replied.",
      "“But you are not going to have it,” said his grandmother. ‘1 shall not give it to you.”",
      "“Very well, then I shall take it,” said Maui, and he looked so strong, and the old woman was so weak from going so long without food, that she let him take it.",
      "Then Maui returned to Earth, holding the jawbone close to his breast, and told his brothers all about where he had been, and what he had seen.",
      "How Maui learned the secret of making fire in the World Below— not in a way to be commended, however — and taught it to his people ; relating, as well, the origin of the existing hot places and boiling hot springs in the South Island of New Zealand.",
      "Maui was a very mischievous boy,and in this he was like a great many other boys. One night he got up very quietly, and put out all the fires in the country, so that when the people got up in the morning they could not cook their food, for they did not know how to make fire. There were no such things as matches in those days, and people had to be careful not to let their fires go out. So now they complained a great deal, and made a great noise; but for some time Maui pretended not to know that anything was the matter.",
      "“What is all this noise about?” he asked at last.",
      "“There are no fires,” they said. “Some one has put them all out, and we do not know how to light them again.”",
      "“Why don’t you go to the World Below and get fire?” asked Maui. “They know how to make it down there.”",
      "They said they knew it, but were afraid to go. Then they asked Maui to go, and even offered to go part of the difficult and dangerous journey with him.",
      "Maui knew the way and said he would go, but he would not let anyone go with him ; so he set out for the World Below, and when he got there, he told his mother how he had put out all the fires, and asked her where the Fire-god lived.",
      "His mother was not at all pleased when she heard of the mischief he had done, and told him he would only get into trouble if he teased his ancestor, the Fire-god, for he was a very bad-tempered old fellow. But Maui said he did not care, and started off to find him. Maui soon found out where the Fire-god lived, because of the smoke. He was busy cooking some meat in an oven made of stones which was covered up with a mat. He had just lifted off the meat and was thinking how good it smelt.",
      "This put him in rather better temper than usual, and he turned round to Maui, and said: “What are you doing here, and what do you want?”",
      "“I came to get a fire-stick,” said Maui. The old Fire-god only grunted, and turned to his meat again. Maui waited a few minutes and said, ‘Give me a fire-stick.”",
      "The old man grunted again, but said nothing. “I tell you I want a fire-stick!” shouted Maui so angrily that at last the Fire-god threw him one to get rid of him. Maui picked it up and went away, but in a few minutes he began to think that it was the secret of how to make fire that he wanted, and not fire only. So he dropped the burning stick into some water and went back to the Fire-god.",
      "“The fire went out because I fell into the water,” he said, holding up his wet hands, which he had put into the water on purpose. “It is the secret of how to make fire that I want to know. Tell it to me.”",
      "The old Fire-god only grunted again, and threw him another fire-stick. Maui took the second stick and went away and put it in the water again. Then he came back and said very angrily, “Tell me how you make fire, or I will make you !” Then the Fire-god became very angry. “You are an impudent fellow,” he said. “I will toss you up high into the air.”",
      "“Tell me the secret of fire-making!” was Maui’s answer. This made the Fire-god still angrier, and he went into his house to put on his magic girdle. Then he rushed after Maui, seized him and tossed him as high as the tallest trees — and you must know that some of the trees were very tall. But Maui made himself as light as a pigeon, and the fall did him no harm. Then the Fire-god got angrier still, and threw him much higher than the tallest trees. Again he fell unhurt, and again and again the Fire-god threw him up, until he was quite out of breath.",
      "“‘Now it is my turn,’ said Maui, and he seized the Fire-god, tossed him clear out of sight, and caught him like a ball when he came down. ” Illustration by John R. Neill. Published in The Magic Jawbone: A Book of Fairy Tales from the South Sea Islands (1906) Henry Altemus Company. ",
      "“Now it is my turn,” said Maui, and he seized the Fire-god, tossed him clear out of sight, and caught him like a ball when he came down. He did this over and over again, until the poor old Fire-god was quite tired out; and just as Maui was going to toss him again, he cried out: “Spare me, and I will tell you the secret of mak- ing fire!”",
      "So Maui let go of him, and the Fire-god showed him how to make fire by rubbing a piece of hard wood on a softer piece, and putting fine fibre between them to catch the sparks made by the rub- bing. But Maui was still angry, because he had been obliged to ask so many times before the Fire-god would tell him how to make fire; so he killed the old Fire-god, and, having obtained the secret of making fire by rubbing sticks together, he went back to Earth and taught it to man.",
      "Maui’s parents were very angry with him for having killed his ancestor, the Fire-god, and asked if he had buried him. He told them he had, and then they said he must dig him up and scrape his bones — a Maori custom to this day. Maui did this and put the bones in dry gourds, and rattled them as he had seen children rattle stones. But the Fire-god could not be killed so easily. He called his bones together and took his shape again, and then ran after Maui. Maui picked up a fire-brand and ran as hard as he could along the road to the Upper World; but on his way, in his haste, he set several places on fire, and the flames pursued and scorched him. The other gods heard his cries for help, and sent a deluge of rain, but still some burning places were not put out, and still burn to this day. Now there are a great many hot places of all kinds in the North Island of New Zealand ; but all these things happened in the South Island, where there are at this time several boiling hot springs of water.",
      "How Maui tied Ra, the Sun, to the Earth to make the days longer, and the Moon to the Sun, as well. How he caught all the Winds but one and shut them up in a cave and made them obey him ; and how he rode upon them when- ever he wished to do so.",
      "Some time after Maui had taught men how to make fire, he married Hine-a-te, the daughter of the Swamp. Like all Maori girls, one of her chief duties was to have food cooked for her husband when he came home at night ; but sometimes Maui would come home and find his food not ready, and then he would grumble. But Hine-a-te told him the days were so short that she had no time to cook food, and hardly time to do anything ; and a great many people said the same thing. They complained that the Sun went down and left them in darkness long before they were ready for night to come.",
      "“If that is the trouble, it can easily be arranged,” said Maui. “We will tie the Sun to the Earth, so that he can not travel so fast or so far.”",
      "“Oh, ho!” laughed one of his brothers. “We cannot do that, neither can you. The Sun is so hot you could not go near him ; and if you could catch him, you could never hold him. Then Maui said: “Go and get some strong flax fibre, and I will show you how to make ropes strong enough to bind even the deathless gods.”",
      "So his brothers brought the fibres of the tall flax-plant that grows in the swamps and on the moun- tain sides, and they plaited many strong ropes, and made nooses with which to catch the Sun-god. Then Maui told his brothers what they had to do. ”We must start long before dawn,” he said, “so as to get to the place where the Sun comes up over the edge of the Earth. Then we must throw the rope over him before he knows what we are about, for he is stronger and moves more quickly than all the other gods.”",
      "So Maui and his brothers got up in the middle of the night, and went a long way over the plains to the place where the Sun rises, and watched for him under a shelter made of the leaves of tree- ferns to keep ofF the fierce heat. Maui carried with him the jawbone that he had taken from his grandmother, and his brothers carried the ropes.",
      "“We must wait until the Sun’s head and shoul- ders are well above the Earth,” Maui told his brothers, “and then we will throw the nooses over him. You must hold the ropes tight while I beat him well with my grandmother’s jawbone till he is so weak that we can easily tie him down.”",
      "When it was time, up came the Sun, all glorious and beautiful, with bright and flaming locks. Maui and his brothers kept still until the Sun’s head and shoulders were well above the Earth, and then they managed to throw the nooses over his head and pull the ropes with all their strength, while Maui beat him with the jawbone.",
      "In vain the astonished Sun tried to break the ropes that bound his mighty limbs, but they were magic ropes and could not be broken. “Why do you do this?” asked the angry Sun. “Why do you beat me so? Do you not know that from me you get all the daylight and the warm sunshine?”",
      "Still Maui continued to beat him, and his brothers still pulled at the ropes. “What have I done?” cried the Sun angrily. But still Maui beat him and beat him, until he begged for pity. Then he told him that he always would travel too fast, and that they would have to tie him up, so that he could not go so fast or so far away. And though he did not like it at all, they bound him to the Earth ; for as he was all tied up with the magic ropes, and sore with the beating they had given him, he could not resist any longer. And the strong ropes with which Maui and his brothers bound Ra, the Sun-god, can be seen at this day through the clouds stretching from the Sun to the Earth. But men do not know that they are the ropes tying down the golden Sun-god, and they call them “beams of light.”",
      "And now that Maui had bound the Sun, his flaming locks no longer fell upon the Earth in great masses and scorched it. Instead they were spread out and fell on the world in tiny golden threads of sunshine, and people did not have such hot sum- mers, and the days were not so short, but long enough to suit every one. The next thing Maui did was to tie the Moon to the Sun, so that when the Sun set, the Moon would be dragged up to light the Earth, which before had been left in darkness quite all night. And then he caught all the Winds except the West Wind, which is the most powerful Wind in New Zealand, and shut them up in a cave and made them obey him. Often he would ride on the South Wind and on the North Wind in pursuit of the West Wind, and sometimes when the West ‘Wind blew gently, men knew it was because it was tired out flying from Maui.",
      "How Maui, being taunted with laziness, made a big fish-hook out of his grandmother’s Magic Jawbone, went a-fishing one fine morning and caught an Island. Also an account of the way in which his greedy brothers formed the mountains and valleys of the North Island of New Zealand.",
      "Now for all Maui could do such wonderful things, he was really a very lazy fellow, and did not like to help with such work as had to be done every day. One day his brothers said to him, “Maui, you never go out with us and help catch fish for food.” And as a great many other people complained of his laziness, at last Maui said to his brothers: ‘Have I not done a great many things that you could not do, and do you think that getting food is too hard for me? ‘You are always fishing ; but the truth is, there is too much water and too little land. I will go with you and show you what I can do.” You see, at that time there was only one large island in New Zealand, instead of two, and although it was a very large island, it seemed a very little bit of land for all that great ocean. So Maui went out with his brothers in the canoe to fish, but first he made a big fish-hook out of his grandmother’s jawbone. *1 want to fish in deep water,” he told them. “Go far out to sea.” When they had gone out a long way, Maui told them to throw their lines into the deep water, and in a minute countless fish came around the canoe, which was soon filled. “Now,” said Maui, “we will see what I can do.” Then he drew from under his mat the line with the magic fish-hook on it, and smeared the hook  with blood from his own finger for bait, for his brothers would not give him any bait. Then he let his line down into the deep blue Pacific, and sang a magic song, and presently the line was roughly pulled about, the waters rose up in great waves, the canoe was rocked violently, and his brothers were afraid he had brought them there to be drowned.",
      "But Maui went on pulling at the line and sing- ing, and all the time the waves rose higher and higher. At last he called out to his terrified brothers : “Here is the fish I came out to catch !” and with many struggles he pulled out the whole North Island of New Zealand, which to this day the Maoris call “Te Ika a Maui,” which means the Fish of Maui. As for the canoe, it lay high and dry upon the middle of the North Island. “Now,” said Maui to his brothers, “do not med- dle with this fish until I come back. “I am going to offer the firstfruits of this land to the gods, and they will scrape with shells the evil spirits who tempted us to take this sacred fish out of the deep pit below the sea. When I come back we will divide the land.” But just as soon as Maui was out of sight his brothers began to quarrel as to how they would divide the prize, which they were trying to cut up with their knives.",
      "The fish wriggled with its head and tail and fins while the brothers hacked at it, and in this way the mountains, the gullies, and the rough cliffs of the North Island were formed. When Maui returned, he was very angry, and said to his brothers: *’I£ you had not been so greedy and quarrelsome, my land would have been smooth and level.” And this is the reason why the North Island of New Zealand has so many mountains and gullies and rough places, and is not a level land at all.",
      "A short chapter relating the disposition Maui made of his two mischievous sons, being incited thereto by a desire to possess their jawbones. An interesting relation concerning the Evening Star, the one that comes out first of all, and the Morning Star that shines after all the other stars have left the sky.",
      "Maui was SO pleased with the fish-hook made cut of his grand- mother’s jawbone, that he thought he would like to have some more jawbones, so as to have hooks of different sizes. He had two very mischievous sons; but though he was so mischievous himself, he did not like other people to be like him in this respect. So one day he said to his sons: “You talk too much and work too little, my sons. I am going to send you up into the Sky. Perhaps you will keep out of mischief up there, and do some work.”",
      "“Besides,” he added to himself, “I want your jawbones, for I think they are good ones.” Now the sons thought it would be a very fine thing to go up into the Sky, so they said: “Very well, father.”",
      "“It will not be best for you to be together there,” he added, “for you would only get into more mischief.” That very night Maui tossed one son high into the Sky, and he became the Evening Star, the one that comes out first of all, and you can see him shining there every fine evening. The other he tossed up at dawn, and he became the Morning Star, the star that you see shining after every other star has faded from the Sky. The Evening Star has to watch to catch the last rays of the Sun as he goes down at night; and the Morning Star has to shine upon the road along which Tane, the god of Light, comes, and heralds the rising of the Sun.",
      "How Maui, in defiance of his father’s warning, went in search of the terrible Goddess Hine, and was conquered by her through the involuntary agency of a little bird. Not an especially edifying end for Maui, although one in keeping with his mischievous and eventful life.",
      "So the years went by, and Maui was always doing some mischief or other, a nuisance to both men and gods, just as he had been when a boy. At last Maui felt that he was getting old, and as he was too proud to die like other men, he remembered what his mother had said to him years before when he visited her in the World Below. So he went to her again, and said: [65]      “I am going to kill Hine, the goddess of Death.” His father, who had been listening, said: “My son, you cannot do that. She is too powerful.”",
      "“But I think I can,” insisted Maui. “When she is asleep I will jump into her mouth ; and if I can once get inside of her, take out her heart and come out of her mouth again, she will never again have power over men.” “My son,” said his father, “you cannot do that. If man once goes into the jaws of Death, he never comes back.”",
      "“But I shall try,” said Maui. “Did I not nearly strangle the Sun-god, and the goddess of Death is not so terrible or so strong as he.” All the time his father was thinking of the magic songs that he had forgotten to sing over his son when he received him in the World Below, and they were the only songs that could have protected him against Death. He knew that if Maui went to find Death, he would never come back alive, and so he begged him not to go. But Maui was obstinate, and only said: “Tell me what Hine is like, and where to find her.”",
      "“If you see the lightning flashes on the horizon, then you have seen the lights of Hine s eyes, his father replied. “Tell me more,” said Maui. Then his father said, sadly: “Her teeth are jagged and sharp, and her jaw is like that of the great shark, and no man returns who once enters.”",
      "But nothing could prevent Maui from going in search of Hine, the Terrible One. And he went alone, for no one would go with him. Now, although Maui had often been cruel, he had always been kind to the birds, and they loved him, in spite of the way he punished them when they did not obey him. One day when he was thirsty, he called to the saddle-back to bring him some water, but it would not, and he threw it into the water. The bird made a great noise over this, and all saddle-backs have been very noisy ever since.",
      "Then he called the hi-hi or stitch-bird, but it would not go, so Maui threw it into the fire, and some of its feathers have been yellow flame-color ever since. Then he asked the tiny bush robin, and it brought the water, and Maui made the feathers over its bill beautifully white as a reward. But the bush robin was so tiny that it could not bring enough water, and so he called to the pukeko, or swamp-hen, and she filled her ears with water, and brought it to him ; and to reward her, Maui pulled her legs out long, so that she could easily get her food in marshy places. And the swamp-hen has long legs to this day. So it was, that when no one else would go with Maui, some of the birds who had been listening, as little birds always do, said they would go with him.",
      "And the little robin, and the big robin, the sweet- voiced lark, the twittering fantail that spreads out its tail like a fan, the swamp-rail and many other small birds came and said to Maui: “We will go with you,” and they flitted along be- side him, so that he should not feel lonely. After he had traveled a long, long way Maui came to the abode of Hine, the goddess of Death; but he could only see her open mouth, and as there were no lightning flashes from her eyes, he knew that she must be asleep. Then he told the little birds to be very quiet, and on no account to laugh, lest they should awaken Hine, the Terrible One.",
      "“We will try to be quiet,” the birds replied, “but we are afraid you will be killed. Do take care, friend Maui.” Then Maui took off his mats, and, after again warning the birds not to laugh, he jumped head first into the mouth of Hine. His head was down Hine’s throat, and his legs were hanging out of her jaws, and he looked so funny that all the little birds had to keep their mouths shut so as not to laugh aloud. It was too much for the little swamp-rail, how- ever, and he laughed out so loudly and merrily, and made such a noise, that it wakened Hine.",
      "She suddenly snapped her mighty jaws together and cut Maui right in two at the waist, and his legs fell to the ground. The little birds flew away at this frightful sight, to tell the sad news of Maui’s death, and they sang no more for many days. As for the little swamp- rail, he was quite cured of laughing. Since that time Maui has dwelt in the Heavens above; and when you see in the sky the hooked tail of the Scorpion, you will know that you are looking at what the Maoris believe to be his won- derful fish-hook."

      "Ruarangi’s wife was so beautiful that the Fairy King fell in love with her and carried her off to his fairy city. There he said a charm that caused her to forget her former life, her husband and her home. When Ruarangi came home at night to find his house empty, his beloved wife gone, his grief was terrible. After a fruitless search he went to a Magician. “Find out where my wife is,” he begged.",
      "“What will you give me for my services?” asked the Magician.",
      "“Half my crop of sweet potatoes.”",
      "“Good. I will find her.”",
      "He made his magic ring and looked through his magic eyes. “Your wife is in the city of the Fairy King,” he said at last. “The Fairy King has said a charm to make her forget you and her home. You must go to the fairy city for her. I will say a spell that will cause her to re member everything when you appear.”",
      "He said the spell. When he had finished he said, “Take red ochre with you to rub on your wife’s skin. The fairies will then be powerless to touch her.”",
      "Ruarangi set off, taking red ochre with him. After many days of travelling, he reached the fairy city, a quaint cluster of peaked houses built on a flat-topped hill. He climbed the hill and walked through the city, but houses and streets were empty. Not a fairy was to be seen.",
      "Ruarangi’s beautiful wife walked on the sports ground with the Fairy King, watching with idle eyes the racing, jumping and throwing of the fairy people. Suddenly, as Ruarangi’s foot touched the empty fairy city on the neighbour hill, the Magician’s spell did its work. In a flash her memory came back.",
      "“My husband! My Ruarangi!” she thought. “What magic has bound me? I must escape.”",
      "Two fairies wrestled on the course. The King and all his people watched with eager interest. “I wish to speak to your brothers behind us, ” she said to the King. He nodded permission, his eyes on the performers. She turned and walked downhill, stopping but a moment to speak to the King’s brothers. Once out of sight, she hurried on, meaning to escape. Passing through the fairy city , she met her husband looking for her. “Ruarangi! My husband! Take me home,” she cried.",
      "Ruarangi’s heart sang for joy. He rubbed red ochre on her face and neck, that no fairy spell should overtake her. Then he took her home. When they reached their country, a great feast of welcome was given by their friends, for joy at their safe return.",
      "On the sports-ground the Fairy King waited for Ruarangi’s wife. When she did not return, he sent a messenger for her. The messenger brought word that she had gone on to the city.",
      "“It is well,” said the King. “She rests. She has but mortal strength.”",
      "When the sports were over the fairies all went home, but she was not in the city. No clue was left but the prints of footsteps down the hill. The King examined the footprints.",
      "“They are those of Ruarangi and his wife,” he cried. “He has dared to enter my city and take her from me. He shall be punished. She shall return. Bring the army together with all speed. In three days we march of Ruarangi’s city.”",
      "For two days the fairy army prepared their weapons and exercised themselves; on the third day they marched for Ruarangi’s home, the Fairy King at their head.",
      "Through the land the alarm was spread by swift-footed messengers: “The Fairy King draws near with his army.”",
      "“Prepare for war,” Ruarangi commanded.",
      "“There is no need,” said the Magician. “There is a better way.”",
      "“Tell us,” said Ruarangi. “What shall I receive for helping you?”",
      "“The other half of my crop of sweet potatoes.”",
      "“Good. Then listen to my words. You can not fight the fairies. Their magic power would render you defenseless. But there are two things against which they have no power: red ochre and the steam of cooked food. Smear yourselves, your fences, and your houses with red ochre; cook food and set it steaming on your posts and roofs. Thus the fairy army will possess no power to harm you or your homes.”",
      "The people listened, and obeyed the words of the Magician. While the men rubbed red ochre over everything, the women cooked great quantities of food and set it steaming on the posts and roofs. With a loud battle-cry, the fairy army drew up in front of the waiting city. A gust of hot steam answered them; the crimson glow of red ochre flashed on their dismayed eyes. “Magic!” they cried in consternation. They turned to fly.",
      "The Fairy King stood forth and called them to endure it. “I will overpower their magic!” he said. Standing in front of his army, he began to chant an incantation that should remove the paint and food. His fairies, listening, took courage to endure the horrid glow and stifling steam. But the Magician, hearing the King’s words, sprang to the gateway of the city and chanted a spell to make the paint and food remain.",
      "More and more loudly they sang, each trying to out-chant the other. Meanwhile, the paint and the food did not move, a sign that the Magician’s power was stronger than the King’s.",
      "At last the Fairy King realized that he was beaten. Turning, he gave orders for retreat. The fairy army marched away, never to return. Ruarangi and his beautiful wife were saved by the Magician’s magic."

      "When he was a baby Maui was lost on the sea shore. But though lost, he was not harmed, for the sea creatures took care of him. Little waves rocked him to and fro, jelly-fish made a soft bed for him, sea-weeds floated above his limbs to shelter him, beach winds crooned light cradle songs to lull him off to sleep.",
      "He slept happily, till hungry seabirds spied him. With their cruel eyes and strong hooked beaks they gathered round him, eager for a feast. The sea-weeds tossed themselves above him as protection, but the birds would certainly have devoured him had not Rangi looked down from the sky and observed his danger.",
      "He called to the mountains, “Lift that child from the sea and hand him up to me.”",
      "The mountains stooped, lifted Maui from hisdangerous bed, and held him high as they could reach. Rangi stretched down his arms, took the little baby, and lifted him into the sky. The disappointed seabirds flew away, and the kindly jellyfish and seaweeds were at liberty once more to float about on their own important businesses.",
      "In the Sky-land Maui lived with Rangi till he was twelve years old. The life was very different from that which he would have lived amongst his brothers on the earth. Sky foods and cloud beds, sky games and sky work, made a most unusual boy of him. Best of all, Rangi taught him magic.",
      "Through his magic lessons Maui learned how to lift with ease a thing a hundred times as big as himself ; how to stretch a few feet of any substance so far that the further end became invisible; how to make himself invisible; how to change himself into any bird or animal he wished. Rangi taught him also many new ways of making ropes and fish hooks, spears and axes — better ways than any earth-man knew .",
      "Maui looked down on the earth and saw his brothers at play. “May I not go to them?” he asked Rangi. “With them is my real home. ”",
      "“Go down if you wish, ” replied Rangi. “I would not keep you here if you prefer a life on earth. But promise first to teach your brothers the useful lessons I have taught you.”",
      "Maui gladly promised. He said goodbye to Rangi and was gently lowered to the beach by his mother’s house.",
      "There his brothers were playing. He joined in their game, but they all stopped to stare at the strange boy. “Who are you? ” one of them asked .",
      "“I am your brother,” he answered. They would not believe him. “We have no brother,” they said. They ran to the house and told their mother that a strange boy calling himself their brother had come to play with them. She hurried out to question him.",
      "“I am your little boy,” he said. “I was lost on the sea shore and have lived with Rangi ever since.”  His mother believed him and took him into the house. She kissed him and told his brothers to be kind to him. So Maui lived at home.",
      "He taught his brothers the useful arts that Rangi had taught him, and he kept them amused by his marvellous tricks. At first they were jealous of their mother’s love for her recovered son; they were inclined to quarrel and be spiteful. But he showed them his magic powers and so won their admiration. He pulled a whale on to the beach, using only one hand in the effort; he changed himself into all the different birds, one after another; he made himself invisible. Awed by his strange powers, his brothers ceased their persecution.",
      "When he was grown up he wandered round the village one night and put out all the fires. This was a serious matter, for the secret of making fire had long been lost. For many years the fires had never been allowed to die out. Now they were gone, and nobody knew how to start another.",
      "In the morning the people cried out in dismay. ‘Some enemy has entered the pah and served us this ill turn,” they lamented. “How shall we warm ourselves and cook our food?”",
      "This was the opportunity Maui had been seeking. “See how helpless we are when our fires go out,” he said. What we need is the secret of making fire. “I will go to the Fire-Goddess for this secret.”",
      "The people exclaimed in horror at his daring. His mother begged him not to expose himself to such danger. But Maui would go.",
      "He went gaily through the dreary dark passages that led below the earth to the cave of the Fire-Goddess.",
      "“Our fires on the earth are out,” he said to her.  “I have come to you for help.”",
      "The Fire-Goddess pulled fire from one of her fingertips, lit a stick with it, and gave the stick to Maui. ",
      "He set off for home, but he was not satisfied. “This will start our fires,” he thought, “but it will not teach us how to kindle fire. It is not what we need. “",
      "Coming to a pool of water, he purposely dropped the flaming stick in it. The fire went out, and he carried the stick back to the Fire-Goddess. “See,” he said, “I dropped the stick in the water. Please give me another.”",
      "The Fire-Goddess drew fire from her next fingertip, lit another stick, and handed it to Maui.",
      "Still disappointed, Maui treated this second stick as he had treated the first. Nine times he came back, and nine times the Fire-Goddess, unusually patient, drew fresh fire from a fingertip. But at the tenth request she woke up to the fact that Maui was tricking her, that he was, in fact, trying to take all her fire from her in order to discover how she set to work to make new flame.",
      "Angry at his presumption, she dashed the tenth fire on the ground. From where it fell a burst of fierce flame sprang. In a moment the whole place was ablaze. Maui fled, the raging Goddess after him.",
      "Faster than the Goddess came the fire. It roared through the passage, coming out to the earth close behind him. The surrounding forest caught, and Maui was soon wreathed in flames. Speed could not save him, for the fire was ahead; he must use his magic. He changed himself into a hawk and flew high above the flames.",
      "But the air above the fire was unbearably hot. Looking down, he saw a pool of water. “I will cool myself there,” he thought. He dived into the pool, but to his horror he found the water boiling with the heat of the fire. He rose hurriedly again into the air.",
      "As far as he could see on every side the land was on fire. Even the sea was boiling with the heat. What to do he could not think, nor how to save his mother’s house and all the houses of the pah. His own life, too, was in danger. He felt he could not bear the heat much longer. Suddenly he remembered Rangi. He cried to him for help. “Send rain,” he begged.",
      "Rangi heard the cry, saw Maui’s danger, and sent rain at once. But the fire was so great that the rain could not quench it, so he gathered all the rain clouds and storms of the sky and sent down a deluge that made a flood. That put the fire out.",
      "Higher and higher rose the flood, till the Fire Goddess was thoroughly soaked and almost drowned. She fled in terror to her cave. All her fire was lost except some sparks which she threw into the tops of the tallest trees .",
      "Maui was saved. He went home and related his adventures. His people had been terror stricken at sight of the great fire and the flood, and were rejoiced to welcome him. “But where is the fire you went to find?” asked his mother.",
      "“It is in the tops of some trees,” said Maui.",
      "He climbed the trees and broke off small dried branches. He rubbed the branches upon one another till sparks flew out. He caught the sparks in twigs and blew them into flame. He had found the secret of making fire. Ever since his people have made their fires from the branches of these trees."

      "When Shining-Eyes threw the Fire-that-never- goes-out into the sky it was only a flaming stick, but it grew rounder and wider and cooler, until at last it became a great Moon-land. It was a wonderland place. Everything gave out a golden light — mountains and lakes, rocks and trees and flowers, and even the walls and spires of a beautiful moon-palace that Marama had built. In the palace lived Marama, all alone. At first he had been so charmed with his fine new land that he had not noticed the loneliness, but after some time he began to say to himself: “Why have I no one to share my work and play? There is no pleasure in playing star-ball by myself, and I am tired of singing with no one to listen. Oh, for a companion!”",
      "He asked the Sky-fairies to live with him, but they refused; they had their stars to guard. He looked down on the earth. A beautiful girl with a calabash in her hand walked to a stream at the foot of a hill for water. A young man ran down the hill after her. “Ina! Ina! ” he called.  It was her old playmate, the friend she loved better than anybody else. She waited for him. They went to the stream together, and Marama watched the return. Several times the girl’s face was turned upwards to the moon; each time Marama thought it more beautiful. All next day he could think of nothing else.",
      "“She would never leave her old playmate and her home,” he thought, ” and yet she is the companion I desire. What a sweet friend she would be.” When night came again he watched for Ina. Down the hill she came as before, her calabash in her hand. Her playmate had not yet appeared; she awaited him. “I will go down! She shall return with me,” said Marama suddenly.",
      "In a flash he stood before her. At first his brightness dazzled her, but little by little she looked at him and saw that he was a stranger. “I am Marama,” he said. “I have come to ask you to live with me on the Moon. It is a beautiful life, and I will be kind to you. Come!”",
      "Ina drew back. “I cannot leave my parents and my home,” she said. “I should be most unhappy.”",
      "“You will soon forget them. On the Moon you will have other joys.”",
      "“But I do not want to forget them. And I have a friend. I will not come.”",
      "“Think how lonely I am up there,” urged Marama. “Ina, you will never grow old in the sky, for I will take you to bathe in Tane’s shining lake, which gives perpetual youth and beauty. Come with me.”",
      "“No,” said Ina, “no, no!” Marama flung his arm round her and lifted her from the ground. She screamed, caught a young palm-tree with her hands, and clung to it with all her strength. Gently but surely Marama lifted her, dragging the palm-tree out by the roots, and carried her up to his Moon-land.",
      "“Marama shows Ina the Moon-Land.” Unknown illustrator, published in Maoriland Fairy Tales by Edith Howes (1913), Ward, Lock and Co.",
      "“Plant the palm-tree here,” he said as he set her down. ” It will always remind you of your earth-home.” They planted the tree on the edge of the Moon, placing the calabash beside it. “Come and see your new home,” said Marama. He led her proudly over his palace and its gardens. She was dazed with her quick flight and the brightness all around her, but she could not help seeing the beauty of the Moon-land. Everything was new and strange. It took her many days and nights to learn to work and play as they worked and played in Sky-land; but Marama taught her gently, and they were soon the best of friends.",
      "She learnt to make fine curtains from the fleecy morning clouds, and to throw them across the sky till they hung like lace-work over the blue. In times of storm she rolled the thunder-clouds; morning and night she painted the domed sky-roof with crimson and purple and gold. She kept the inside of the Moon-palace as bright and beautiful as Marama kept the outside, for she grew to love her home.",
      "When the day was over came the time for play. Then Marama and Ina danced and sang, played with the stars, rode on the moonlit clouds, paid flying visits to Rangi or the fairies. Every month they bathed in Tane’s shining lake, so that they should never grow old, but should for ever remain young and gay and beautiful. But although Ina was so happy, and although she had learned to love Marama and her moon- home, she never forgot her old life, as Marama hoped she would. Deep in her heart lay the memory of her parents and her friend. Often when the earth lay lit beneath the Moon she would stand for hours under her palm-tree, trying to see the hill and her friends. Until she had bathed in Tane’s lake, she could not distinguish objects at such a great distance ; after that, however, she found that she could see perfectly. Now, when she looked down, she saw her old playmate travelling wearily over the land in search of her, while her mother sat in the doorway wailing for her lost child.  Full of pity for her sorrowing friends, Ina flew to Marama.",
      "“Marama,” she said,” my mother weeps for me, and my friend roams the country in search of me. Look on the earth and you will see their sadness.”",
      "Marama looked below. “If my old playmate could see how happy I am he would be pleased,” she went on. “Bring him here for a visit, Marama, that he may ease my mother’s heart on his return.” ” It is well said. I will bring him here,” said Marama.",
      "He flashed down to the earth, seized the young man in his arms, and carried him up to the Moon. Ina stood awaiting them. Astonishment and joy shone in her old friend’s eyes as he stared at her. Ina told him what had happened to her on that night when she disappeared from the hillside, and he told her how her friends had sorrowed for her ever since. Ina showed him the wonders of the Moon-land, and talked of her great happiness in living there. “I can never come back to the earth,” she said, “for I have bathed in Tank’s lake ; but you must not think I am unhappy here. Indeed, I would not return to the earth if I could, the pleasures of this life are so great. Stay with us for a little while that you may see what happiness is mine.”",
      "He stayed with them, and they taught him the work and the play of the sky. When it was time for him to return Ina said: “Tell my mother and my friends what you have seen, that they may not sorrow for me any longer.”",
      "She called the rainbow, charging it to carry her old playmate safely to the earth. The rainbow hung over the earth, Ina said farewell to her friend, and he slid down the shining bow to the hillside. When he told Ina’s mother of her daughter’s new life and great happiness, she dried her tears and rejoiced. As each night fell, and the Moon rose high in the sky, the earth-friends spoke of Ina and Marama and the wonders of their Moon-land home. Ina was satisfied. But she has never lost her love for her old earth-home. Even now, when the Moon is clear of clouds, you may see her gazing earthward, the tall palm-tree above her head, and the calabash at her feet. That is what you see if you look hard at the moon when it is at the full."

      "The Sea-king in his palace under the water heard the sound of bitter weeping on the shore. “Somebody is in trouble,” he said. “I must see what is the matter.”",
      "He changed himself into a fish and swam to the shore to look. A woman walked along the beach, wailing loudly.",
      "“Why do you weep?” asked the Sea-king.",
      "The woman stopped, looked into the water and saw the fish, and guessed that he must be the king.",
      "“I weep because I have lost my husband, ” she replied. “We quarrelled, and he left me. He lives now in the next village. Why we quarelled I hardly know, for indeed we love one another. I have been to the village to beg him to come back to me. He would have come, but his friends laughed at him for yielding, so I return alone and sorrowful. ”",
      "She told her tale with such heartbroken sobs that the Sea-king’s pity rose on her behalf .",
      "“I will send a message to the village; may be your husband will soon return to you, ” he said. “Go quietly home and await events.” The wife went home, not much comforted. She was doubtful of the Sea-king’s power on land.",
      "The Sea-king himself had no doubts. He called a sea-gull. “Go to the village near by, ” he said, “and tell the people to restore the husband to the wife. Say that I, the Sea-king, command it.”",
      "The sea-gull flew with the message. “Restore the husband to the wife, ” she called from the wall surrounding the village. “It is the great Sea-king who sends the word. ”",
      "“The Sea-king! Who obeys him?” laughed the villagers. “Go back. Tell your Sea-king that the husband stays with us as long as we desire it. ”",
      "The gull returned with the insulting message.",
      "The Sea-king was pale with anger. “They dare to laugh at me and doubt my power! ” he cried. “They shall pay for this. I will teach them to obey.”",
      "From his palace he sent a summons to all fighting fish, big and little , to come to his aid. They crowded round his palace in their smooth grey coats , which in those days were one and all alike .",
      "“Soldier- fish!” said the king, “your help is needed. Sharpen your teeth and polish your skins this night, for in the morning we go to battle with men. On land my power has been insulted. ”",
      "The fish spent the night in polishing their already shining skins and sharpening their teeth and the spines of their fins and tails. In the morning they swam in ranks before the palace doors, ready for the fight .",
      "The Sea-king swam out, changed to the likeness of the biggest fish of all . Placing himself at their head, he led them to the battle. Below the sea they swam in their hundreds of thousands, rising to the surface as they neared the shore .",
      "Scrambling up the beach, they marched across the country to the village.",
      "The people of the village, seeing them coming, ran out to watch this strange army––fish marching on dry land .",
      "“What a joke” they said. “Whoever saw this before?”",
      "One man, wiser than his fellows, shouted , “It is the Sea-king’s army. This is no joke, but grim war. Remember, we laughed at the Sea-king’ s power. To your houses for your spears and axes! ”",
      "Some one cried , “But fish cannot fight with men. ”",
      "“We must destroy this army or it will destroy us, ” replied the first .",
      "The men ran to their houses, caught up their spears and axes, and came out to fight the fish.",
      "Now began the strangest battle ever seen. Over the wall of the village slid the great fish army, rank on rank, column after column , until the ground between the houses was covered with their moving bodies. The men speared and hacked and cut at the fish, while the fish fought fiercely with sharp teeth and spiked fins and flapping tails, or threw the men by wriggling with polished skins beneath their feet .",
      "The battle raged all day. The men fought for supremacy , but the numbers and the courage of the fish wore them out . When evening came , on all sides men lay wounded and beaten ; the fish army had won .",
      "The Sea-king stood high in his kingly shape again , looking down on the beaten men .",
      "“You will send back the husband to the wife, ” he commanded .",
      "“Yes, ” they answered .",
      "“You will never again laugh at my power on land?”",
      "“No.”",
      "“That is well. Bid the husband stand before me . ”",
      "The husband came. “Back to your wife! Quarrel no more. Treat her kindly and be happy, ” said the King .",
      "Without a word the husband turned and went home to his wife, to live with her happily ever after .",
      "The Sea-king led his victorious army back to his sea-palace. “You have done nobly, ” he said . “ Ask me what boon you will , and if it is mine . to give you shall have it. “",
      "One by one the fish swam up and stated each his heart ‘ s desire . One by one their requests were granted. Most of them had seen strange sights upon the land, colours and forms such as were never seen below the sea. From these they chose their gifts. A Cod had gazed upon the gorgeous colours of the sunset, and asked for these upon its back. Another preferred to wear the soft blue of the summer sky. One had seen a boy ‘s kite , and wished to resemble it in shape; that is why today the Skate is broad and flat. One wished to be red like blood, and to be able to groan like a wounded man; and so you may always hear the Gurnet groan when it is caught. One asked that a spear might be fixed at the end of his nose ; to this day he carries it there, and men call him the Guard-fish .",
      "So, in turn, every soldier won what he most desired . This is how the fish obtained their varying shapes and colours. These are their rewards for bravery ."

    "title": "The Six Brothers",
    "author": "Edith Howes",
    "content": [
      "In the beginning, so the ancient stories say the land was dark. No light ever shone upon its surface, for Rangi, Master-of-the-Sky, hung low over Papa, the earth. In Papa’s garden, which was the land, no flowers grew nor trees; nothing but strange half-grown plants whose leaves were flattened as they pressed against great Rangi’s arms.",
      "For the sake of being together, Sky-father and Earth-mother forgot to care for the growth of flowers and trees, and even for the lives of their own children.",
      "In the low dark garden lived six sons, knowing nothing of the light, but wondering much what lay outside, and longing, as they grew  to stretch themselves and stand upright.",
      "Once Rangi lifted up his arms, and for a radiant moment the light streamed in.",
      "“Oh, what is that? ” the brothers asked.",
      "“It is nothing but the light,” said Rangi. He dropped his arms again and darkness fell.",
      "“But it was beautiful!” cried Tāne,the eldest of the brothers. “Lift your arms again, Rangi. Let us look at this wonderful thing you call light.”",
      "“No, no,” cried Rangi; “be contented as you are.” But the brothers were no longer contented. They began to make plans for letting in the light.",
      "“Our home would grow beautiful,” said Tāne, ” and besides, we could see to move about.”",
      "“If Rangi would but move and give us room we could stand upright,” said Tu, the next in age.",
      "“Let us ask him!” said the rest.",
      "They begged Rangi to give them light and room, but he would not move. “No,” he said, ” I am happy here. My place is near the Earth-mother.” Many times they asked, but each time he refused. The brothers grew angry.",
      "“Kill him,” said Tu, who was the fiercest.",
      "“Push him up,” said Tāne.",
      "“Leave him alone,” said Tawhiri.",
      "For a long time they argued. At last they decided that each brother should try to push him up out of the way.”I will try first,” said Rongo. He pushed with all his strength, but he could not move the great Rangi.  Haumia tried, and Tangaroa, and Tu, but none of them could move him.",
      "Now Tāne put forth all his strength. Pushing with both hands against Rangi’s mighty chest, he raised him slightly from his resting-place.",
      "“Ah, the Light! the Light! ” cried the brothers. “Push, Tāne, push harder yet.”",
      "Tāne pushed, using his feet for greater strength. The light streamed in. Higher and higher rose the helpless Sky-giant. The Earth-mother wept aloud as Rangi was torn from her. Tāne, resting a moment from his labours, heard an answering cry from above.",
      "“Cruel Tāne! You have left me on the mountain peaks. They are tearing my sides.”",
      "Tāne looked up. He had become a giant, had pushed Rangi to the mountain tops, and in his breathing space had left him there to rest upon their jagged peaks.",
      "Quick as thought, he ran across the land and up the mountain sides. Lifting Rangi off, he bound up his wounds; for Tāne was not really cruel. He was determined, however. When he returned to his brothers he said: “I shall send him so high that he can never come down again.”He stood on his head and hands. Bending his right knee, he kicked Rangi so far into the heavens that he has had to stay there ever since.",
      "“Now let us make the garden beautiful,” said Tāne.",
      "Tawhiri said, ” I shall not help you. I shall go to Rangi.” For Tawhiri was always jealous of his brothers. He went to Rangi, and lived with him in the sky. The others stayed with the Earth-mother, making her garden beautiful.",
      "Tāne said, ” I will make trees.” He made trees and bushes, flowers and moths and butterflies, and sweet singing birds. The sunshine fell warmly on the garden, and everything grew. Tāne was well pleased. Rongo made all the food-plants that grow in gardens; Haumia made wild food-plants ; Tangaroa filled the rivers and lakes and sea with fishes.",
      "“Earth-mother,” said Tāne, ” weep no more for Rangi. Be happy in your garden.”",
      "“I am pleased with your love for me, and all your kindness to me,” said the Earth-mother, “but I cannot cease weeping for Rangi. I think always how cold he must be in the sky, for he is not warmly clad.”",
      "“I will clothe him better,” said Tāne. He made a warm wide cloak of glowing red for Rangi. “I will fasten it with stars,” he said. “They are the most beautiful things I have ever seen.”",
      "He went to the Star-goblin. “Give me stars for Rangi’s cloak,” he begged.",
      "The Star-goblin said, “They lie on a mountain at the end of the sky. You must take a long and dangerous journey to reach them.”",
      "“I will go,” said Tāne.",
      "It was indeed a long and dangerous journey, but Tāne was not afraid. He strode gaily over the mountain tops and through the wild dark lands of night, coming at last to the mountain at the end of the sky. Here he found the gleaming stars piled above the precipices. He gathered a number of the largest and brightest, and took them back with him.",
      "He stood on the mountain peaks and set the stars in the cloak. But he found that in the sunshine they did not show. So he made a dark cloak for night-time, and placed them in that. There they shone brilliantly.",
      "The Earth-mother smiled, well pleased. Still, she was not quite happy about Rangi. She said, “I am afraid lest he should fall from that great height and be hurt.”",
      "“I can prevent that,” said Tane. He made soft cloud pillars. With these he propped up Rangi that he should not fall.",
      "So in his kindly way Tane did what he could for Rangi and the Earth-mother. But these two have never recovered from the sorrow of their parting. Often in the night Rangi’s tears fall upon the Earth-mother’s garden; men, seeing these tears, call them dew. He looks fondly down upon her from the sun and moon, which are his eyes; she sends up soft sighs of mist to tell him of her never-dying love. Yet they are not quite separated, for their hands, outstretched, touch each other on the low horizon.",
      "The brothers were at last happy. Only Tawhiri, still jealous, would not be at peace. He made the winds, setting them at opposite corners of his sky-home. One day he called them, together with all the storms and hurricanes, all the rain, hail, and black clouds of the sky. Sweeping down through the air with these terrible helpers, he fell upon Tāne’s beautiful trees, beating them to the ground.",
      "Tane was too late to save his trees, but he called to his brothers to warn them that Tawhiri had come. Rongo and Haumia, in their fear, changed themselves into roots and hid in the garden. Tangaroa changed himself into a fish and jumped into the sea. These brothers have lived in those places ever since.",
      "But Tu stood on high land, where Tawhiri’s floods could not reach him. There he waited for his jealous brother. When Tawhiri came, he fought him and beat him, and made him promise to stay quietly in his sky-home, leaving his brothers in peace. Tawhiri still sometimes sends his winds to tease his brothers, but he is too much afraid of Tu to work any serious mischief.",
      "Tāne re-planted his trees, and they grew into mighty forests. The garden grows more beautiful every day, for never again can the light be shut out."

      "Tāne gazed on red clay that lay exposed where earth had fallen from a cliff. “Red, the sacred colour!” he said; “and earth, from which all things grow and flourish. Surely from this I can make something greater than anything I have yet attempted.”",
      "He gathered the red clay and worked it with his hands, kneading it and fashioning it into a shape like his own. When the shape was made he breathed into it his own breath. Slowly life went into the figure, and it began to breathe as if in sleep.",
      "Tāne stood, chanting a life-giving song. The limbs received their powers, the eyes opened and saw the world. The shape arose and walked. It was Tiki, the first man, whose heart and all inner parts were red as the clay from which he was made.",
      "Tāne, invisible, watched the man walk with dazed and wondering eyes across the barren plain where he had lain towards the forest trees where birds were singing. Invisible goddesses floated through the air to look at this new creature. “He will need a mate,” they said.",
      "From the Sunshine that quivered on the trees and the Echo that wandered through them, the goddesses wove a fine mist, which limb by limb they shaped into a woman. They sent her out to meet the man, and he was lonely no more. The two lived together in the Earth-mother’s garden, and from them have all the men and women come that live there to this day.",
      "Tāne went to live in the shining Sunrise Land, beside the Lake of Glowing Light. So Tu was left master of the garden, for he alone of the six giant-brothers was left. Ever since, the men and women who live there have received good things from four of the brothers—from Tāne’s trees wood for boats and houses, fibrous leaves for ropes and clothing; from Rongo and Haumia roots and berries; from Tangaroa fish. But from Tu they received an evil gift, for he taught them the art of fighting. Yet, strange to say, they worshipped him more than any of the brothers. They made him their god of war; and since then peace has left the earth."

One of them said, “I wonder whether this Earth-prince is as brave and handsome as they say he is. I will go down to the earth to see.”",
      "One summer morning she descended to the earth. Herself unseen, she watched Tawhaki, finding him even braver and more  handsome than any one had told her. Indeed, she was so pleased with him that she came out of her hiding­ place and made herself known to him.",
      "Each day she came down to talk to him. He was glad and proud, for no Earth-princess was half so beautiful; besides, was she not a Sky­-fairy? At last these two became so fond of one another that they were married.  The Sky-fairy left her home above the clouds, and lived on the earth as Tawhaki’s wife.",
      "Such a thing had never happened before. When the other Sky-fairies heard of it they were exceedingly angry. ",
      "“She belongs to us,” they said. “She must come back.”",
      "But she refused to come.  “I love Tawhaki,” she said. “I will not leave him.”",
      "They made up their minds to carry her off. One day they swooped down upon the island and carried her away  before Tawhaki’s  very eyes.",
      "She struggled with all her strength to free herself, while Tawhaki tried to hold her back and beat the Sky-fairies  off.  But  the Sky-fairies were too powerful. They pushed Tawhaki aside and carried his wife  away.  “Sky-fairies must not live on the earth,”  they said.  “You shall never return to Tawhaki.”",
      "“Come to me, then, Tawhaki!  Come to me in the sky!” she called, her voice growing fainter as she was borne out of his hearing.",
      "Tawhaki stretched up despairing arms. What could he do? He had no means of following her. And yet, the loneliness without her! For many sad and weary days he wandered hopelessly about, unable to find a way of reaching her.  He  asked the eagles to carry him, but they replied that they could  never reach the sky. He climbed mountain after  mountain, but none was high enough.",
      "One morning, passing through the mountain­land, he came upon an old woman, sitting alone. An old, old woman she was. In her hand she held a fine white spider-thread.",
      "“Who are you?” asked Tawhaki.",
      "“I am called the Old Grandmother,” she replied. “What  are  you  doing  in  this  lonely  place?”",

      "“In the sky.”",
      "“What is it for?”  asked  Tawhaki eagerly. The old woman eyed him steadily. “If a man on the earth wished to go to Sky-land he might climb this thread,”  she said. “It would bear him, but he must be very brave, for if he once looked back or lost heart he would fall and be dashed  to  pieces. I  do not think any Earth­ man is brave enough to attempt the deed.”",
      "“Try me. I  will go!” cried Tawhaki,  his heart beating with joy. He guessed that this thread had been sent down by his wife that he might go to her.",
      "“Give me the thread,” he said.",
      "The Old Grandmother was pleased at his courage, but she warned him of his danger.  “It is such a tiny, slender  thread,” she said. ” One slip, one moment’s loss of courage, would dash you on these mountain-tops.”",
      "“I shall not be afraid,”  said Tawhaki. “My heart is too full of love to have room for fear.”",
      "“Listen then,” she said. “I will teach you a charm.  Sing it if ever your strength seems to be leaving you. By it, too, you can change yourself as you will.”",
      "She sang the charm, and he repeated it until he knew it.",
      "“Now you may go,” she said. “Keep a brave heart, remember to never look back, and, if your strength fails, sing the charm.”",
      "Grasping the spider-thread, Tawhaki sprang from the earth, and began his wonderful climb to Sky-land. What a frail thread it was! It swayed and swung with his weight, but he had faith in its magic power to hold him. He clung and climbed, higher and ever higher, until he was level with the tops of the lower hills.",
      "Up still, and higher yet. Now he was level with the highest mountains. Now he was above them. He was  passing   through Cloud-land. What if the thread should break or come loose? He would not think of such accidents. His wife was at the top.",
      "It was cold, cold and wet in Cloud-land, and he had been climbing for hours. His strength began to ebb. Then he remembered the charm, and sang it with all his might as he passed through the great lonely spaces beneath Sky-land. Over and over again he sang it, till weariness fled and strength returned.",
      "Climbing now quickly and joyfully, he came to the first of the ten Sky-lands. He pushed himself through the flooring, and it cracked in all directions. A deluge of water rushed through the hole. He sprang up and looked round. The water was overflowing from the edge of a lake in which Sky-fairies were bathing.",
      "“That water will make a flood on the earth,” he thought; but he did not stay to look  back, nor even to watch the Sky-fairies. He knew his wife’s  home was not here, but on the fourth Sky-land. He grasped the thread again, and went on his way.",
      "When he reached the second Sky-land  he met a snake-shaped fish. Behind this fish crawled hundreds of smaller ones. “Who are you?” Tawhaki asked boldly.",
      "“I am the Eel-king,” replied the fish. “I am looking for water. Up here we are parched and dry. How is it in the earth?”",
      "“Uncomfortably wet, I should say, for I have cracked the lowest Sky-land and let the water through from the fairies’ lake,” said Tawhaki.",
      "“Good! ” said the Eel-king. ” The  earth is the very place for us. Come, my children, to this delightful earth.”",
      "With his wriggling people he slid down through the hole to the earth, and here he has stayed ever since. Before that there were no eels in the creeks and rivers of the world.",
      "On the third Sky-land Tawhaki met the Pukaki. The bird stretched its long neck in astonishment at the sight of an earth-man. “Where are you going?” he asked.",
      "“To the fourth Sky-land,” replied Tawhaki. “What is the earth like just now?” was the bird’s next question.",
      "“Very wet. Flooded, in fact,” said Tawhaki.",
      "“You don’t say so! ” cried the bird joyfully. “Why, that is the kind of world I want. Here there is no swamp. I shall go down to the earth. Tell me, do the fairies know you are on your way to their land?”",
      "“No,” said Tawhaki. “I do not wish them to know that.”",
      "“Oh, indeed! Then I shall give them warn­ing.”",
      "The mischievous bird raised his head to give a cry that should reach the fourth Sky-land.  Just in time Tawhaki caught him by the nose, pinching it so hard that the Pukaki could make no sound. He pulled, and struggled to break loose, but Taw­haki held on.",
      "Tawhaki said, “Will you promise to keep quiet if I let you go?”",
      "A subdued droop of the bird’s tail seemed to answer “yes,” so Tawhaki loosed his hold.",
      "The Pukaki fled down through the hole to the earth. Ever since that day his nose has been red from Tawhaki’s pinching, and all his children and children’s children have been hatched with crimson noses.",
      "Tawhaki climbed the fourth Sky-land. Here the thread ended. He looked about him. This Sky­-land was beautiful, clothed in green forests and decked with bright flowers. Through the trees he saw the gleam of water. Listening, he heard the sound of voices. He crept quietly towards the voices. Near the lake the fairies who had carried off his wife were making a canoe.",
      "“If I follow these fairies I shall find my wife,” thought Tawhaki; “but they must not know me, or they will send me down to earth again. I will change my form.”",
      "He stole back into the  forest, and softly sang his charm. By the time it was finished he had the appearance of a poor, miserable old man. No one would have recognized in him the handsome Tawhaki.",
      "He walked slowly towards the fairies.  ” Look at that old man,”  said one.  “Where has he come from?”",
      "“Make him work,”  said  another.  “He shall carry our axes home.”",
      "They loaded Tawhaki with axes, and he followed them towards their home.  “What  would my people say if they  could see their Prince carry­ing tools like a servant? “he thought.  “But it is for my wife’s sake. For her I will suffer anything.”",
      "An idea came to him. He called to the fairies, “Do not wait for me.  I am old, and cannot walk fast. I will follow you slowly.”",
      "The fairies went on.  As soon as they were out of sight Tawhaki changed himself to his old strength of limb.   ",
      "Running back to the canoe, he worked at it until one side was finished. “My work is better than theirs,” he said. “They may be glad to learn from me.”",
      "He ran through the forest till he almost reached the fairies, then he returned to the form of the old man carrying the axes. At the fairies’ home he saw his wife. She sat sadly by herself, taking no interest in anything. She glanced at the old man following the fairies, but did not recognize him as Tawhaki. He dared not make himself known. “I must first finish the canoe,” he thought.",
      "Early the next morning the fairies again set off for the forest, Tawhaki carrying the tools. When they reached the canoe the fairies stood lost in astonishment. “Who has been working at our canoe? It is half done. And so well done! Who can it be?”",
      "Nobody knew, and of course nobody suspected the feeble old man. After talking a great deal about it, and coming to no solution of the mystery, they set to work, chopping and adzing all through the day. When the evening came Tawhaki did exactly as he had done the night before. The next morning the other side of their canoe was finished.",
      "“Tonight we will watch,” they said. This was just what Tawhaki wished. When the evening came he changed himself into the strong and handsome Tawhaki, knowing that the fairies were waiting in the forest to surprise him.",
      "They came rushing out from behind the trees. “We have found you at last, kind worker,” they shouted.",
      "He turned his face to  them, and they saw that he was Tawhaki!",
      "Without a word he set off at a run for his wife’s hone. The angry, puzzled fairies followed him. Some said: “He shall  not stay.  Send him back to earth.” ",
      "Others said: “Let him stay. He can teach us the building of canoes. We can make a Sky-fairy of him, and his wife will then be happy.”",
      "They reached the house. Tawhaki ran in and stood before his wife. She knew him now and sprang to meet him. They held each other’s hands, and showed their joy so plainly that the fairies could not bear to part them. “He shall stay,”they agreed.",
      "They gave him fairy power, so that he can never die. Today he lives in happiness with his fairy wife. So powerful has he grown in magic that men, hearing his footsteps on the floor of Sky-land, call them thunder; and when he lifts his arms lightning flashes from his armpits."

      "Somewhere far across the sea lies Hawa-iki, that wonderful Motherland where the sun’s rays glow from early dawn to sudden night. Nobody knows now where that old land is, nobody has ever found it again, but its far-strewn sons and daughters still tell of its remembered glories, its radiant sunshine, its flowers and butterflies, its white-topped mountains and its mighty streams. Some think it may have been India, while others say it must have been some age-old continent which has since sunk and now lies buried under the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The brave people of that old Motherland were ready for adventure. When wars and famine drove them out from their ancient homes, they said, ” Let us set out across the sea that we may find new homes in which to live.”",
      "They sailed across tropical seas to the islands of the Pacific, some now and some again, setting up their homes where the cocoa-nut and bread- fruit grow. There they lived their island lives, swimming, diving, fishing, boating ; sometimes making long voyages in their carved canoes far out into the great unknown seas. One voyager returned with tidings of a new land seen far to the south, with white- topped mountain peaks such as had shone in Hawa-iki. “Let us go to that land. These islands are already overfull,” said some.",
      "They prepared for the voyage. They built three great canoes, so long and wide that hundreds of people could sit in them. They curved them high at the prow, and ornamented them with beautiful carving. They loaded them with food and water and everything necessary for a long voyage. Then those who were departing bade farewell to friends and sailed across wide, lonely seas to look for that new land.",
      "Ngatoro the magician was there. He resolved to put a stop to all quarrelling. With a mighty spell he raised a storm so fierce that the voyagers cried out in fear. Chanting more loudly still, he drew a terrible whirlpool from the depths of the sea. It rose in front of the canoes. The people shrieked.\n“Save us, Ngatoro!” they begged. “We quarrel no more.”",
      "Changing his spell, Ngatoro quietened the storm. The wind dropped, waves and whirlpool fell away, the canoes went on their quiet course. The thankful people, remembering their lesson, quarrelled no more throughout the voyage. After many weeks they saw a long white cloud that seemed to hang across the meeting-place of sea and sky. All day they drew nearer to it. Next day they saw it plainly — the new land. At the welcome sight weary eyes brightened with relief. “Ao-tea-roa,” the voyagers called it — “Land-of-the-Long- White-Cloud.’ ‘",
      "As they drew near the fairness of the land came into view. Mountains reared their snow- wreathed heads above the cloud; from them green forests ran down to the sea. Here and there the gleam of mountain torrents showed between the green, or clusters of crimson flowers glowed beneath the sun. The people cast off their red necklaces and ornaments. “In this new land we can pluck gems from the trees,”they said, gazing at the crimson rata flowers.",
      "They sprang on shore. With joy they found that this new land was rich in food and water. They settled, built houses, and planted the sweet potatoes they had brought with them. They fished, speared birds, and hunted the moa. Ngatoro the magician said: “I go to travel through the new country, enriching it and making it safe for my people.”",
      "He went. At his magic word hills were levelled, marshes were dried and made firm for walking. Stamping on the ground, he brought forth springs of water wherever they were needed. He travelled through the forests, placing guardian fairies everywhere. He said: “I go to climb yonder mountain. Fast till my return, that my magic power may be sustained.”",
      "He climbed and climbed. When he was hidden from their sight among the clouds, the people forgot his words and ate. At once his magic power left him. Crawling painfully where he should be striding lightly, he reached at last the top, only to sink exhausted in the snow.",
      "He was freezing in the bitter cold, yet he had no strength to help himself. “I perish,” he said, unless the Fire-god send me help.” He called, and the Fire-god sent help; from the mountain-top fire spouted, flowing over one side. Ngatoro, warming himself, gathered strength to finish his work and descend to his people. When they heard how their carelessness had nearly cost their beloved magician his life, the people were sorry. They promised never again to forget his words.",
      "“The fire on the mountain will remind you,” he said. The fire still burns, sometimes far down, some- times at the top. Men call that mountain a volcano. The voyagers stayed on in their new land. When the last of them had gone to his long rest there were thousands of their children left. These lived and loved and died, as men and women have always done, and their children took their places. So five hundred years have passed. The new land has become old, and the story of the great voyage a tale of long ago.",
      "But still, in the Land- of-the-Long- White-Cloud, as in the sunny islands of the tropics, the ancient stories of the unfor- gotten Motherland are told, blended with new happenings in the newer lands. They are the old traditions of the race ; mysteries of moon and star and the making of the world, of fire and life and death, and of the making of man. Among them too are brave deeds of ancient heroes, and the doings of princes and magicians and the fairy folk that lived in every forest. Listen, little white children of to-day, while I tell you these stories that have for centuries been told to the little brown children in these far islands of the South."
